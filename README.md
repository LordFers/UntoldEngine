# Untold Engine

## Introduction

**The Untold Engine: An easy to use, open source, 3D game engine for iOS/macOS game development**

Hi, my name is [Harold Serrano](http://www.haroldserrano.com), and I developed the [Untold Engine](http://www.untoldengine.com), an open source 3D game engine written in C++ and Metal Graphics (API).

It took me over five years to develop the *Untold Engine* from scratch. I spent thousands and thousands of hours developing the Untold Engine, and now I'm releasing it as an open source.

## Contributing to Untold Engine

Since this project has barely been released as an open-source, I am not taking Pull-Request yet. I want to complete the documentation and write more tutorials before allowing Pull-Request.

If you want to help out, I would appreciate if you could report back any bugs you encounter. Make sure to report them at our [Github issues](https://github.com/untoldengine/UntoldEngine/issues), so we all have access to them.

Thank you.

Once I feel that the documentation is ready, I will allow Pull-Request.
